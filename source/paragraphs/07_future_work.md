# Future Work
## Allowing a variable size chunk message
In the future it might prove advantageous to have chunk messages with variable sizes. We could support this by introducing a "length" field.

## Hash algorithm negotiation
In the future there will be better hash algorithms than SHA-3. We could introduce some form of hash negotiation.
